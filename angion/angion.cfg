[Mutation]
variability: 0.01  # amount to vary terms by if mutating. 0.1: +/- 10%.
number_of_terms: 3  # how many terms of a termset to mutate. terms are not limited to a single mutation.
probability: 0.5  # 0 -> 1 chance a term will be mutated at all


[Function]
maximum_terms: 3  # maximum terms in a termset
term_creation_chance: 0.0007  # chance to add new terms to a term set
term_deletion_chance: 0.0005  # chance to delete a term (multiplied by number of terms)


[Branch]
segments: 2  # how many segments has each point?
every: 5  # split into branching_factor segments every branch_every points


[Plot]
size: 1024  # pixels, square
margin: 64  # don't score the outer plot_margin pixels, but allow fractals to grow there


[Fractal]
origin_x: 512  # x coordinate of where fractal begins
origin_y: 512  # y coordinate of where fractal begins
recursion_limit: 50  # Hard limit at this depth


[FitnessTest]
service_grid_spacing: 16  # spacing of grid used to check how well-covered the area is.
